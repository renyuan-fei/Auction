<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

1. Using your terminal or command prompt clone the repo onto your machine in a user folder

```
git clone https://github.com/renyuan-fei/Auction.git
```
2. Change into the Carsties directory
```
cd Auction
```
3. Ensure you have Docker Desktop installed on your machine.  If not download and install from Docker and review their installation instructions for your Operating system [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
4. Build the services locally on your computer by running (NOTE: this may take several minutes to complete):
```
docker compose build
```
5. Once this completes you can use the following to run the services:
```
docker compose up -d
```
6. To see the app working you will need to provide it with an SSL certificate.   To do this please install 'mkcert' onto your computer which you can get from [here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).  Once you have this you will need to install the local Certificate Authority by using:
```
mkcert -install
```
7. You will then need to create the certificate and key file on your computer to replace the certificates that I used.   You will need to change into the 'devcerts' directory and then run the following command:
```
cd devcerts
mkcert -key-file carsties.com.key -cert-file carsties.com.crt app.carsties.com api.carsties.com id.carsties.com
```
8.  You will also need to create an entry in your host file so you can reach the app by its domain name.   Please use this [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-edit-hosts-file-in-windows-mac-or-linux) if you do not know how to do this.  Create the following entry:
```
127.0.0.1 id.carsties.com app.carsties.com api.carsties.com
```
